                Payout timing varies by location, typically granting access to your platform balance within 2 to 7 business days. In supported regions, the default payout rhythm is automated on a daily basis, ensuring your platform balance is transferred daily upon eligibility. Alternatively, you retain the choice to opt for weekly or monthly payout frequencies based on your preference.

                All refunds are paid out in a merchantâ€™s local fiat currency to end customers. For any specific refund related questions please reach out to your HIFI account representative.                </p>

                HIFI complies with the requirements of Section 6050W of the Internal Revenue Code. This Section requires payment processors to provide information to the IRS through Form 1099-K reporting. This requirement <strong>only</strong> applies in the case of merchants that receive payments from HIFI Pay of more than $20,000 in gross volume and <strong>more</strong> than 200 separate payments in a single calendar year.

                <p>
                Although NYDFS categorizes assets support into Approved for Custody and Approved for Listing, HiFi will only support assets that meet both the criteria for custody and listing. As a result, there may be assets that are available for one or the other according to NYDFS, which we will not support for Participants in NY.
